 Face Recognition System

This repository contains an implementation of a **Face Recognition System**, leveraging machine learning techniques to recognize and verify faces from image data. The system is designed for real-time or batch processing, making it suitable for various applications such as security systems and attendance management.

 Features

- **Face Detection and Recognition:** Accurately identifies faces from input images or video streams.
- **Preprocessing Pipelines:** Efficiently processes images to enhance recognition accuracy.
- **Visualization:** Displays detected faces and recognition results.
- **Extensible:** Allows integration with additional datasets or recognition models.

 Getting Started

 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required Python libraries (install using `requirements.txt`):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Face_Recognition_System.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Face_Recognition_System
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

 Dataset

- Ensure the dataset (`faces_dataset/`) is available in the `data/` folder.
- Replace or update the dataset with your own images if needed.

 Running the Project

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or upload it to Google Colab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook face_recogination_system.ipynb
   ```

2. Execute the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Train and evaluate the face recognition model.
   - Test the system with new images.

 Running on Colab

- Upload the required dataset files to Colab when prompted.
- Modify file paths in the notebook if necessary to match the Colab environment.

 Outputs

- Detected faces and recognition results are displayed in the notebook.
- Results can be saved to the `outputs/` folder for further analysis.

 Future Enhancements

- Integrate real-time video stream processing.
- Use pre-trained deep learning models for improved accuracy.
- Add a user interface for ease of use.
